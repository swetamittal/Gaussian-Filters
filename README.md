# Gaussian-Filters

A Gaussian filter is a linear filter. It's usually used to blur the image or to reduce noise. The Gaussian filter alone will blur edges and reduce contrast. The one advantage a Gaussian filter has over a median filter is that it's faster because multiplying and adding is probably faster than sorting.

# TYPES

There are two types of gauusian filters namely low pass gaussian filter and high pass gaussian filter.
